It's just poorly distributed. \r\nI'm at lunch with the forty most influential people in town this week, and no one is touching their gourmet food. Every uneaten lunch is thrown in the garbage. Multiply this experirnce by a few thousand and welcome to restaurant food waste in Vancouver. \r\n\r\nWalk six blocks East of this luncheon of the elite and you will encounter the hundreds, possibly thousands, of individuals who have found their home on the street. For these equally valuable individuals food is a real, tangible need. These two environments are within wslking distance. Why is there such a divide? \r\n\r\n###Enter seconds. \r\n\r\nWe connect unwanted food with people who want it. ",
